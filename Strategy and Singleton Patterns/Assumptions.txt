Assumptions:

1) I made the two strategies (Network Manager and Database Manager) using Singleton Pattern because
   none of them have their private data members. So its memory efficient to make each strategy using singleton
   pattern. (Concurrency and multi-threading issues are ignored for now to keep it simple)

2) The mobile app is made using singleton pattern because the user should not be allowed to create
   multiple instances of the same app.
